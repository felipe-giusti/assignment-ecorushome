# What I plan on doing in order

1. I'll first try to work with HN api and get a feel for it
2. After that, I'll add my own api and implement each of the routes / functionality
3. If I have the time, I'll try to add some testing, but I'll leave it for the end of the assignment.

4. The first version of the api should be working / almost completed now, I can try to work on:
    - async reads
    - clean comment text?
    - Adding caching to the system
    - make the api more modular - example: you can filter how many post to look (and only cache the information requested?)
